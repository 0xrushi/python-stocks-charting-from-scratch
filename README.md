This is a dashboard to show backtrading strategy testing on any stock. I plan to shut down this project as many new and better libraries have arrived like [https://www.quantopian.com/](https://www.quantopian.com/) Still, I hope it would be helpful to get started in making candlestick related dashboards.

#Alongwith matplotlib, numpy, pandas you would need mpl_finance install it from
#make sure to give proper path of the stock (zeel.csv here).

pip install https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl_finance/archive/master.zip
